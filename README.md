# WhatsApp-Chat-Sentimental-Analysis
Abstract
With the exponential growth of social media users, 
people are really curious about the type of conversation they 
have with other people and also how communication leads in 
group chats, with this Web App tool we focus on providing the 
user with insightful analysis of their chats with other people, 
some of the statistics include, total messages, total words, most 
used words, emoji analysis, and some more, off all the social 
media chatting apps we have chosen WhatsApp as it is used 
purely for conversations purposes so that it can provide us with 
the most helpful dataset, after performing these analysis, we 
have also performed machine learning analysis using 
supervised machine learning algorithm Random Forest 
Classifier in order to perform sentimental analysis, we have 
used Random forest classifier as it is a boosting algorithm and 
provides extremely good results for binary classification. We will 
export our WhatsApp chats and we can directly upload it to our 
Web App to get the sentimental analysis.
